    "[Back to top](#TOC)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the period of recession we tend to be more conservative which requires a higher expected recall level from the model's \"default\" prediction. Thus, at development stage, recall is a control, and the **expected precision** and the **expected ROI** are the consequence and thus metrics. At deployment stage, however, real-world recall and ROI became the metrics for both the model and the business.\n",

    "[Back to top](#TOC)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is estimated using a portfolio in August, pretending that the same transactions / overdue amount would happen for Novemeber (which was a bad assumption). When an user is predicted \"default\", his/her card is freezed so no additional transaction fee nor overdue fee would be generated, and the bank would not suffer loss from the user's transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the true good users will be counted to the numerator(revenue) of the ROI, and only the true bad users will be counted towards the denominator (cost) of the ROI.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the model's tradeoffs between profit/ROI and recall, using a recall over 0.6 will start to see profit dropping, and when recall is above 0.8, the ROI became volatile, and required careful examination of the remaining users.\n",

    "[Back to top](#TOC)\n",
    "\n",
    "An action plan was illustrated in below, together with important inputs showing on the left hand side of the flow chart. One key concern is that usually a grace period can be up to 2 months, which is also the waiting time for us to finally find out if an user will miss the payment or not. The long period of waiting is not favourable in an organization faster-paced, and may invalidate the result for short-term reuse(e.g. due to seasonality). Therefore, sample size control had to be careful to allow more cycles running in parallel while for each cycle maintain the statistical significance. \n",

    "- Recall/cost/profit/ROI/etc could be used as control to fine-tune the outcome of the model, \n",
    "- Improvement needed to make user segmentation and better prediction results.\n",
    "- Engineered features were helpful, because (1) it took 3 out of the 5 places in the casual selected feature set, (2) it provided improvement over the raw features."
